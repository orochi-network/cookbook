# Halo 2 for Dummies
[Halo 2](https://zcash.github.io/halo2/) is succint non-interactive zero-knowledge argument of knowledge (zkSNARK) library for developing application with associated zkSNARK argument, or proof, in order to prove their honesty in computing the programs.

In [ETHVietnam 2022](https://www.eth-vietnam.com/agenda), I presented a simple implementation of using Halo 2 to build a program producing a proof for a simple polynomial computation. The content in this section follows my talk this conference, namely, ETHVietnam 2022.
